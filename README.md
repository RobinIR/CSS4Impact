# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to gather relevant data from various sources through web scraping, making it accessible for social scientists' research endeavors. The collected data will be systematically stored within a database and locally on a drive. To enhance usability, a dedicated website will be developed to present the data comprehensively. The website will offer user-friendly interfaces, enabling efficient data retrieval based on various filters. The project encompasses data from three distinct countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine.

## Technologies Used

- Scrappers : Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup4
- Database: PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker
- Website: React.js, Next.js

Certainly, you can provide an overall installation process in the main readme file that guides users through setting up the different components of your project. Here's how you could structure the installation instructions:

# Project Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the different components of the project: **Website**, **Scrappers**, and **Database**. Each component has its own dedicated folder with a corresponding readme file that contains detailed installation instructions.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (for Scrappers)
- Node.js (for Website)
- Docker (for Database)

## 1. Scrappers

Navigate to the `Scrappers` folder and follow the instructions in the [Scrappers](./Web Scrappers/README.md) to install the web scraping components using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup4. These components are responsible for extracting data from various sources.

## 2. Database

Proceed to the `Database` folder and refer to the [Database](./Database/README.md) for guidelines on setting up the PostgreSQL database using Prisma and Docker. This is where the collected data will be systematically stored.

## 3. Website

Finally, head over to the `Website` folder and review the [Website](./Website/README.md) for details on setting up the React.js and Next.js application. This application will provide a user-friendly interface to access and interact with the collected data.

## Conclusion

As this project focuses on data from Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine, it not only enables researchers to explore these specific regions but also serves as a blueprint for expanding to other countries and regions in the future.
