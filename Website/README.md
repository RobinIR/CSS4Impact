# CSS4ImpactFrontEnd

# Project Description

The task is to develop a web frontend with a table that includes paging and filtering functionality. The table should display certain properties and allow users to navigate through the data and search based on filter criteria. The goal is to provide the user with an efficient and easy way to find the desired information in the table.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a declarative and component-based architecture.
- Next.js: A framework built on top of React.js that adds features like server-side rendering, static generation, and API routes for improved performance and productivity.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built CSS classes for easy and flexible styling.

## Development Process

- Used React.js as the foundation for the frontend development due to its extensive ecosystem and component reusability.
- Utilized Next.js to leverage its server-side rendering, static generation, and API route capabilities, improving performance and SEO.
- Employed Next.js API routes for creating mock data during the initial development and testing phase.
- Integrated the frontend with the backend by redirecting the API routes to the production backend once it was ready, ensuring a seamless transition from mock data to real data.
- Chose Tailwind CSS for styling the frontend, taking advantage of its extensive collection of pre-built CSS classes and flexibility in customizing designs.
- Leveraged the Tailwind CSS community's resources, including documentation, examples, and extensions, to enhance the development process.

## Conclusion

The combination of React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS offers a powerful and efficient solution for developing a web frontend with advanced features like paging, filtering, and dynamic data loading. The use of Next.js API routes enables seamless integration with the backend, while Tailwind CSS simplifies the styling process. By leveraging these technologies and frameworks, the project aims to deliver a user-friendly and performant web application for data exploration and retrieval.
